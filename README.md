# Hyperparameters
Hyperparametrs are the parameters that the machine can not learn through regular input data.
Parameters are
We can optimize hyperparameters by several stratergies like Guassian and frequentist by bayesian is the most promising.
Bayesian optimizer picks a prior belief and then searches the parameter space by enforcing and updating that prior belief during training.
