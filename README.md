# Hyperparameters
Hyperparametrs are the parameters that the machine can not learn through regular input data.
Hyperparameters are settings that control the learning rate of a machine learning model.
We can optimize hyperparameters by several stratergies like Guassian and frequentist by bayesian is the most promising.
Bayesian optimizer picks a prior belief and then searches the parameter space by enforcing and updating that prior belief during training.

## Hyperparameter tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal parameters for the model's hyperparameters
